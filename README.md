# stargazer

This is a modified version of `stargazer` that I changed how it reports the *t*-statistics output in regressions table: row 6495-6502

In particular, I need the *t*-statistics are inside parentheses, but the default outputs are "t = " and without parentheses.

To install it to your local R:

```
devtools::install_github("diengiau/stargazer")
```
