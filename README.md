# stargazer

This is a modified version of stargazer that I changed how it reports the t-statistics output in regressions table: row 6495-6502

The purpose of this change is to make the regression outputs fit my need. I need the *t*-statistics are inside parentheses, but the default output is "t = ".

To install it to your local R:

```
devtools::install_github("diengiau/stargazer)
```
